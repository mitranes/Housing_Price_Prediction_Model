This is a housing price prediction model using multiple linear regression and feature scaling (z-score normalization). The dataset is based off the free dataset you can find https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data and was reduced in # of features since this was one of my first projects tackling multiple linear regression. The train_copy.csv file was used to train the model and the test_copy.csv was used to predict the home values.
